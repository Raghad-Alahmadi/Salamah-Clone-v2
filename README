# Salamah Clone

## Overview

Salamah Clone is a project aimed at replicating the functionality of the original Salamah application. This project is designed to provide similar features and user experience, focusing on a permit requester registration form with dynamic field prefill, form validation, and submission using the Fetch API.

## Features

- **Dynamic Field Prefill:** Automatically fills form fields (e.g., Commercial Registration Number, Business Type, Email, Phone, etc.) when the user enters a company name that matches data from the API.
- **Form Validation:** Ensures all required fields are filled out correctly before submission.
- **Form Submission:** Submits form data to an API endpoint using the Fetch API, excluding sensitive fields like passwords.
- **Success and Error Handling:** Displays success popups for successful submissions and error messages with animations for validation or API errors.
- **Terms & Conditions Popup:** Provides a detailed Terms & Conditions popup for user agreement.
- **Loading Spinner:** Shows a loading spinner during form submission to enhance user experience.
